Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter. Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? \n#Person1#: We don't . \n#Person2#: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system. \n#Person1#: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, but other than that , tipping isn't customary. \n#Person2#: What about cab drivers and porters? \n#Person1#: In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter. I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag, but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities. \n#Person2#: You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.

Pull up a chair. \n#Person1#: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \n#Person2#: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \n#Person1#: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \n#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \n#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \n#Person1#: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \n#Person2#: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\n#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?\n#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n#Person2#: Fifty meters.\n#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",
