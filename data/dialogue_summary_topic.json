Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it?\n#Person2#: We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there.\n#Person1#: Ok. What sort of things would you like?\n#Person2#: Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again.\n#Person1#: Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for?\n#Person2#: Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure.\n#Person1#: Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week.\n#Person2#: Ok.",

As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display.\n#Person1#: Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive.\n#Person2#: Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.\n#Person1#: What about the outer packing?\n#Person2#: We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton.\n#Person1#: Cartons?\n#Person2#: Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes.\n#Person1#: Could you use wooden cases instead?\n#Person2#: Why use wooden cases?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load.\n#Person2#: The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle. They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo. The stevedores will see to that. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps. Silk blouses are not fragile goods. They can stand a lot of jolting.\n#Person1#: Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London. If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined.\n#Person2#: No need to worry about that. The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof, and as the boxes are made of cardboard, they will be handled with care.\n#Person1#: Well, I don't want to take any chances. Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage.\n#Person2#: Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage.\n#Person1#: Maybe so, but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage, the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing, or packing unsuitable for sea voyage.\n#Person2#: But cartons are quite seaworthy. They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports. There are never any complaints from our clients, and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W. P. A. and T. P. N. D.\n#Person1#: If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing, we would be quite willing to accept cartons.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers. We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy, but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap.\n#Person1#: I can understand your position. Perhaps I'm asking too much.\n#Person2#: We'll use wooden cases if you insist, but the charge for packing will be considerably higher, and it also slows delivery.\n#Person1#: Well, I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter.\n#Person2#: Please do.

I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney. \n#Person1#: Mm-hm.

So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. \n#Person1#: So, did you, did you lose your finger? \n#Person2#: Almost. \n#Person1#: Almost.

You can't see it.\n#Person2#: I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court.\n#Person1#: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins?\n#Person2#: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed.\n#Person1#: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves?\n#Person2#: That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor.\n#Person1#: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law?\n#Person2#: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory. It is being worked on. The World Trade Organization has developed an agreement, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years.\n#Person1#: That doesn't make sense. Twenty years is a long time.\n#Person2#: Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent. On the other hand, other inventors can use the information the inventor disclosed when the product was registered. Giving the information is all part of the deal.\n#Person1#: Cool.",

The highest production level was reached in 1990 with a total of 293 million bottles.

But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n#Person1#: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n#Person2#: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n#Person1#: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n#Person2#: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when we use fossil fuels for a long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect, there could be extinctions of many creatures, such as polarbears.

In football, a team has 11 players. In rugby there are 15 players on each team. The biggest difference is that in football, only the goalkeeper can use his hands. In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted.\n#Person1#: In rugby, players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates, don't they?\n#Person2#: That's right. However, players can only pass the ball backwards. They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates. That's a foul.\n#Person1#: I know how goals are scored in football, but how about in rugby?\n#Person2#: If a team carries the ball over the goal line, they score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch.\n#Person1#: There's a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn't there?\n#Person2#: Yes.

Where were the atheistic educators?\n#Person1#: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.\n#Person2#: How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?\n#Person1#: That's because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.\n#Person2#: So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.\n#Person2#: Why did they want to found a college?\n#Person1#: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see.\n#Person1#: Actually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name.\n#Person2#: When did it begin to be called Harvard University?\n#Person1#: In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard.

Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course. \n#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi? \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so.

The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. \n#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine? \n#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.",

He became professor of Mathematics at the University of Manchester at twenty-four, where he remained for twelve years. During that time he married one of his students, Natasha Willoughby.\n#Person2#: Yes. Go on.\n#Person1#: Later, working together in London, they laid the foundation of modern Physics by showing that normal laws of cause and effect do not apply at the level of subatomic particles. For this he and his wife received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1910, and did so again in 1912 for their work on very high frequency radio waves. In his lifetime Hawtin patented 244 inventions. Do you want any more?\n#Person2#: Yes. When did he go to America?\n#Person1#: Let me see. In 1920 he went to teach in New York, and died there suddenly after only three weeks.

I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring.\n#Person1#: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?\n#Person2#: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.\n#Person1#: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course.\n#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?\n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.\n#Person2#: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?\n#Person1#: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.\n#Person2#: Sauvignon Blanc? What's that?\n#Person1#: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.\n#Person2#: Let's see. The label says it's got ' attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled. ' Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I'm on my way to the dinner now.\n#Person1#: It's OK, don't worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but. . . this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.\n#Person2#: All right. What varietal is that?\n#Person1#: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.\n#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine?\n#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.\n#Person2#: Perfect! I'll take it!",

So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family.\n#Person1#: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that?\n#Person2#: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake.\n#Person1#: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years.\n#Person2#: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time.\n#Person1#: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit?\n#Person2#: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities.\n#Person1#: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely.\n#Person2#: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.\n#Person1#: A hotel sounds nice.\n#Person2#: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.\n#Person1#: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease.\n#Person2#: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.\n#Person1#: Wow.\n#Person2#: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important.\n#Person1#: What about money? I have a credit card.\n#Person2#: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must.\n#Person1#: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated?\n#Person2#: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated.\n#Person1#: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful.",

I really appreciate that. So, what time are we going?\n#Person1#: Well, let's see. The movie stars at 10. We should be there at least 1 hour earlier, because there is a big line. I could pick you up at your house at 8, if that's ok with you.\n#Person2#: 8 pm, that's fine with me.\n#Person1#: Okay.\n#Person2#: So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that's great.

If we do the floors first, and then paint the walls, we will get paint all over our new floor. \n#Person1#: Hmm. Maybe you're right. But I can't stand all this green carpet in here. And besides, I know how to paint. I will just cover everything with drop cloth. I won't get anything on the floor. \n#Person2#: Are you sure? \n#Person1#: Yes, I'm sure. I've done a lot of house painting in my life. And my mother was very picky. If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture, she would get furious. So I learned to be very careful.\n#Person2#: Alright. Then maybe we can do the floor first. These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful. And me too--I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here. But how can we get it out? Do we need to call helpers?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not. We can remove the carpet ourselves. Carpet is held down with carpet nails. You just need to pull it hard and it comes up. \n#Person2#: Great. Then, after we remove the carpet, we need to restain all the wood floors. Right? \n#Person1#: Yes. But we should hire someone for that. That will probably be expensive. And it has to be done right. \n#Person2#: And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in. \n#Person1#: Sure. If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so.

You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap. \n#Person3#: You mean we can't just buy curtains already made? \n#Person2#: Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.\n#Person1#: While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook in there. I don't want to use that electric stove. \n#Person2#: We will need to find an interior decorating company do redo the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen of colors.\n#Person1#: I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners. \n#Person2#: Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook. \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so.

So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day. Of course, I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports, although she didn't specifically ask me to. Without her support and encouragement, I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time. But she was open to suggestions, so long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs.

I'd like, if possible, to see it settled at this meeting.\n#Person2#: What is it, Mrs. Wang?\n#Person1#: It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them.\n#Person2#: Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?\n#Person1#: Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.\n#Person2#: Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.\n#Person1#: The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.\n#Person2#: As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export.\n#Person1#: I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.\n#Person2#: The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.\n#Person1#: We've already got in touch with the underwriter. But they have refused to accept any liability. They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage.\n#Person2#: That's a matter over which we could exercise no control, then. I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement, that is, if you have covered this risk in your coverage.\n#Person1#: To my regret, we failed to cover contamination. This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us.\n#Person2#: Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case.\n#Person1#: Well, live and learn. It seems we'll have to waive the claim.",

Well, the report basically look into the various beliefs that people hold about old age and tries to prove them.\n#Person1#: And what do you think your report can achieve?\n#Person2#: We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age.

And this is very dangerous for our society.\n#Person1#: But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick.\n#Person2#: No, we can't.

How can I help you?\n#Person1#: I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content.\n#Person2#: I see. Here's a pamphlet about our home insurance policy. We've named our policy ' umbrella '. May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are.\n#Person1#: I understand. I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100, 000 for my home.\n#Person2#: Let me just check that on my computer. Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.\n#Person1#: In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000. what does that mean exactly?\n#Person2#: It means that the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you. The insurance policy covers any amount above that, up to the agreed limit.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. That's fine. What is the advantage of having higher deductibles?\n#Person2#: If you have higher deductibles, your premium are lower, because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less.\n#Person1#: It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding. I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree.\n#Person2#: We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders. These are renewable after the first year.\n#Person1#: If I have a claim, how long does it take to make a settlement? I've heard that with some insurance companies, it can take months.\n#Person2#: That is of great concern to out clients. We aim to satisfy all claims within a month, but we can't guarantee that.",

We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price. And with the sole agency in your hand, there will be no competition and you can easily control the market, which would naturally result in bigger sales. I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty.\n#Person1#: Well, if you put it this way, I'll have to comply.

How does that work? \n#Person2#: Usually you meet lots of people but there's a couple of things you need to do. One is I usually stay away from anything touristy or where the tourists are because people just assume you're a tourist and nobody will bother to meet you. The best place to meet people though is a gym. So in every city, I would go to, I would sign up for a gym for two weeks or one month and you always meet people there. So gyms are great, you meet people right after work. You kind of feel like you're in a normal work flow. Parks, you meet a lot of people in parks. You go to where the local people are, maybe a food court or libraries, stuff like that, so usually places where people are actually trying to do something productive, either study or exercise or whatever, you meet people. \n#Person1#: That was going to be my next question. What about your health? How do you maintain a health when you're living that kind of. . . \n#Person2#: Well, yeah, you gotta eat well and you gotta exercise. I did go to the hospital in Chiang Mai because a dog bit me. Yeah. \n#Person1#: Oh, no. Did you have to get rabies shots? \n#Person3#: I had to get a rabies shot and it was really cheap so in most countries healthcare is really cheap. Thailand healthcare is excellent, I mean absolutely fantastic. And you know Vietnam it's cheap. You know even in big places like Taiwan or Korea, you know, you'd be surprised like it's not that expensive. You just got to go to the hospital and they'll sew you up. \n#Person1#: And language problems? Did you ever have any language issues? \n#Person2#: No, usually not. I mean like I lived in Thailand for four years so I can speak Thai but like Taiwan everybody spoke really good English. I went to Korea, didn't know a word of Korean. I stayed there for six weeks working from there and everybody was so nice. A lot of gestures so I got by and actually I remember getting on the plane to go home from Korea and I realized I didn't know even how to say yes and no in Korean or one, two, three, four, five and I was in their country for five weeks, six weeks. So, yeah, the Koreans were very nice. \n#Person1#: Good. \n#Person2#: So have I sold you? Would you like to give it a try? \n#Person1#: Yes, I would but I, my problem is like motivation.

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n#Person2#: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n#Person1#: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n#Person2#: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n#Person1#: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n#Person2#: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n#Person1#: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n#Person2#: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.",

I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.\n#Person2#: Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.\n#Person1#: Ah, Mrs. Miller, but in this case am I covered?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction.\n#Person1#: All right, but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair.

It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n#Person1#: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n#Person2#: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n#Person1#: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n#Person2#: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients.

Since they help increase energy and also just make people feel generally happier. For me personally, I like swimming and yoga, but most of the time I play tennis. I've been playing it ever since I got to school running, playing ball games and doing Tai Ji have also become very popular. Among many of us students and teachers dancing in the morning is especially popular these days. It is quite a scene to see so many people dancing together on the sports ground in the morning. I plan to join the crowd next term. My third year in college, I think it will be great fun. You would think it would be hard for students to get up so early with classes beginning at 8:00 AM, especially in the winter, but there are in fact, more People on the sports ground in the morning in the winter than in the summer. There are of course, some students playing football in the afternoon and some practicing Tai Ji in the evening when it's nice and quiet. Students can receive 2 credits for after class sports.

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for.\n#Person2#: Where are the jobs?\n#Person1#: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg.\n#Person2#: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place.\n#Person1#: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias.\n#Person2#: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends!\n#Person1#: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high.\n#Person2#: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays.\n#Person1#: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares.\n#Person2#: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain?\n#Person1#: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.\n#Person2#: And what about accommodation?\n#Person1#: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think.\n#Person2#: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities?\n#Person1#: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center.\n#Person2#: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for?\n#Person1#: I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too!\n#Person2#: So we'd be there long enough to enable John to complete a university course.\n#Person1#: Well, yes we would, unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the UK. But, yes, if he did want to go to university in Germany, there'd be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities. Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany.\n#Person2#: Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view.\n#Person1#: I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter.\n#Person2#: I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain. But we'll only be abroad for five years, and if we're going to be away, let's choose the most attractive place we can.\n#Person1#: Right. That's agreed. Now all I have to do is get the job!",

Can you imagine?\n#Person1#: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n#Person2#: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

What colors does the new Accord come in? \n#Person2#: We have this new model in red, white, black, or silver. These are the standard colors. Of course you could specially order from various other colors too. \n#Person1#: My brother has last year's Accord. And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver.

' The Chinese friend replied, ' Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It's even worse. '\n#Person2#: Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people's appetite.\n#Person1#: I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said ' American way. ' It's amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way?\n#Person2#: The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?\n#Person1#: Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won't drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn't like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.\n#Person2#: It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people's appetite. Westerners like to say, ' bon appetite ' before meals which is one way to suggest ' mind your table manners. ' Is there such an expression in Chinese?\n#Person1#: Yes.

Doctor Seuss is his pen name.\n#Person1#: I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think.\n#Person2#: Those stories are also great for classroom use.\n#Person1#: How's that?\n#Person2#: Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words.\n#Person1#: So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again.\n#Person2#: Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun.\n#Person1#: Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight.",

The most amazing thing is all the advertising is done through websites. People set up tables in their sitting room or in a city car park, an empty factory, anywhere in fact and because you know how many people you're cooking for, food doesn't get wasted.\n#Person1#: So why is it good for you?\n#Person2#: Well, various reasons, like I could buy all the things without risk because customers pay in advance. The greatest advantage, though, is by having 10 customers at most. I don't need to hire a waiter.\n#Person1#: Do you ever run into problems?\n#Person2#: The whole experience is fun.

If two people of different religions marry, they should be prepared for the consequences. It is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show. Little things, from food and clothes to bigger aspects like religious beliefs, tend to clash, leading eventually to a rift.

First, we have a fitness center where you can have a weight training so that you can lose some weight.\n#Person2#: And that sounds good, but I'm not really interested in getting fit. I just want to get rid of my tiredness and be energetic.\n#Person1#: In that case, you may be interested in our sports facilities...\n#Person2#: Mm, well, I like to go swimming and I find that helps me relax. Do you have any swimming facilities at your place?\n#Person1#: Certainly. We have two 25-meter pools here.\n#Person2#: Can you tell me how much that costs?\n#Person1#: Well, for non-members, it costs just $10 for each time.\n#Person2#: I think I need to do something more relaxing, though, you know, like meditation. Do you have anything like that?\n#Person1#: Well, meditation is part of our yoga classes, which we have every day. And during the special offer period, non-members can take part for just $35 per class.\n#Person2#: OK, thanks very much for your help. I'll come down this afternoon and arrange a yoga class.\n#Person1#: Sure, I'm looking forward to seeing you then.",

And how many hours a day on average do you watch TV?\n#Person2#: Not a lot really... I should say just over an hour.\n#Person1#: So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?\n#Person2#: Well, a little around breakfast time and then it tends to be really late eleven or even midnight- when I've finished work.\n#Person1#: And what sort of programmes do you go for?\n#Person2#: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows.\n#Person1#: Fine. And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?\n#Person2#: Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information..., you know, providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for younger viewers..., you know, good quality stuff.\n#Person1#: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them?\n#Person2#: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system.

OK, this will be a commercial channel of course, but how often do you think it is tolerable to have adverts?\n#Person2#: Well, out of that list I'd say every quarter of an hour. I don't think we can complain about that, as long as they don't last tot ten minutes each time!\n#Person1#: Quite.

Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n#Person1#: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that.

Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?\n#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.\n#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.\n#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!\n#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.\n#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.\n#Person2#: You have always been so soft, Dave!\n#Person1#: Open your heart Dick.

It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time.

Yeah, but maybe not for long.\n#Person1#: So, how can we help you today?\n#Person2#: Okay. Uh, my wife is really into gardening, and about five years ago, she received a beautiful climbing rose bush ... I think an Agatha Christie [That's a nice one.] from her mother who has passed away. Anyway, the rose plant seems to be on its last leg.\n#Person1#: Really? Nomally, that rose is really quite hardy [I know.], and it's very disease-resistant, too. [I know.]\n#Person2#: Yeah. Well, this situation ISN'T normal. You see about a week ago, I was doing some yard work, and I was using some weed killer [UH-oh.], yeah, to try to get rid of some terrible weeds and ...\n#Person1#: Did you spray the roses?\n#Person2#: Uh, well, not exactly. I set the spray container down near the roses while I was trimming a bush, and the container must have gotten knocked over, and the weed killer soaked into the ground near the roses.\n#Person1#: How much weed killer are you talking about?\n#Person2#: Uh, about six or seven quarts (about six liters or 1.6 gallons), I think. [Oh, that's a lot.] You know, I mean when you put ...\n#Person1#: And the roses? What do they look like now?\n#Person2#: Oh, Dead, real dead. Dead as a doornail dead, but my wife hasn't seen them yet.\n#Person1#: Really? What have you done? Blindfolded her?\n#Person2#: Well, I've kept her away from that side of the house where the roses are, but she is bound to see them at some point.\n#Person1#: Yeah, yeah. You've got a problem.\n#Person2#: I mean, is there anything I can do to revive them?\n#Person1#: Not unless you're a magician.\n#Person2#: Well, can you recommend a quick-growing variety that can take its place?\n#Person1#: Marc. I'm sorry. You've made a mistake ... A big mistake.\n#Person2#: ... except that my wife warned me this could happen ... Oh, man.\n#Person1#: Oh, shoot. Listen. You made a blunder. A big mistake. A really big mistake. But unless your wife goes on vacation for a couple of years, you're not going to be able to replace the roses that fast.\n#Person2#: So, any recommendation? I mean, what do I do?\n#Person1#: You need to talk to her.\n#Person2#: Are you kidding? You don't know my wife.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. Look. You've waited long enough. Don't let the grass grow around your feet. Say something, but be sure to hide the garden shears before you do. Kneel down; ask for forgiveness now.\n#Person2#: But that's what I did when I killed her prized apple tree last year.\n#Person1#: No way. Really?\n#Person2#: Oh, man. Oh!

My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.\n#Person1#: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?\n#Person2#: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.\n#Person1#: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?\n#Person2#: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, my boss and I stayed until 2 a. m. for two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort.\n#Person1#: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome.\n#Person2#: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved. My boss was impressed with the work I had done.\n#Person1#: What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n#Person2#: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, and sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more.\n#Person1#: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss.",

What would you like to know?\n#Person2#: First of all, how big is it?\n#Person1#: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer.\n#Person2#: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex?\n#Person1#: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure.\n#Person2#: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all?\n#Person1#: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.\n#Person2#: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay.

Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time?\n#Person1#: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit.\n#Person2#: Oh, and how much is the deposit?\n#Person1#: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of.\n#Person2#: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out?

Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine.\n#Person2#: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants?\n#Person1#: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year.\n#Person2#: Uh ... I don't know.

How do you counter that?\n#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late.

I already know where we're going to go. \n#Person1#: Alright, alright. I am happy to try more Chinese food. Will it be dim sum again? \n#Person2#: No, dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, or sometimes closer to breakfast.

It's likely that old people may go into a nursing home, but it's not as simple as that. Because of improvements in medical science, people live longer than ever before. The birth rate has fallen. This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention.

As a member of TO, China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members. Is it fair to China, do you think?\n#Person2#: It's a hard question, but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question. After the establishment of new China, our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy. These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises. After China's entry into TO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts. This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies. These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run.\n#Person1#: We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement. This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise. Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?\n#Person2#: Yes, it does. Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises, regardless of their nationality and ownership. I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous, these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle.

But you don't need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: What about the salaries?\n#Person1#: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I'll be getting the equivalent of about 22,000 pounds a year there, but only 20,000 pounds at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic I'd have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administration, whereas the Pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching.\n#Person2#: Mmm...\n#Person1#: Then the type of teaching is so different. The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit of exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories, and a couple of children's classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.\n#Person2#: Well, that sounds much more varied and interesting. And I'd imagine you'd be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school, and moving around quite a bit.\n#Person1#: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic position, I'd be stuck in the school all day.",

They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon.\n#Person1#: I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, when I wanted some quiet time, and people kept talking and laughing aloud, it was torturous. For me a room to myself, even a small one, is ideal. Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I crave my own space. I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time. We all need our private space. But I also think interpersonal skills very important.
